1)Impact of other methods of null value imputing
2)Look at the evaluation and 1997_1998 kde and apply necessary transformations
3)outlier removal/ deciding what to do with them
4)deseasonlization if required (experimenting)
5)experiment with following models - xgboost, lstm ,random forest, adaboost etc
6) if models give good result we use the data of evaluation and train that too for testing of 1997_1998(its risky tho)
