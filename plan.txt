1)Impact of other methods of null value imputing
2)Look at the evaluation and 1997_1998 kde and apply necessary transformations
3)outlier removal/ deciding what to do with them(same look at the test sets formore information)
4)deseasonlization if required (experimenting)
5)create lag features and other features like(binary classification of el nino/la nina) (trial exp)
6)experiment with following models - xgboost, lstm ,random forest, adaboost etc
7) if models give good result we use the data of evaluation and train that too for testing of 1997_1998(its risky tho)
